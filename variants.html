          Sinistea are said to be created when a lonely spirit possesses a cold,
          leftover cup of tea. The teacup that Sinistea lives in is a famous
          piece of antique tableware; seafoam green in color with a lacy pattern
          that resembles a face and gold rims. However, there are many forgeries
          in circulation. Antique Form Sinistea has a mark of authenticity on
          the bottom of the cup, whereas Phony Form Sinistea lacks it. This mark
          appears as a light grey emblem on the bottom inside rim of the cup.
          The swirl pattern on Sinistea's purple body serves as a weakness.
          Should a Sinistea get stirred, the swirl will disappear and cause it
          to get dizzy. Sinistea can absorb the life-force of anyone who drinks
          it. While it can wait patiently, most of Sinistea's opportunities end
          up being short, as it tastes so bad that it is spat out
