          Sound, is located south of Sinnoh. It was the first region to be
          introduced. It is the setting of the Generation I games, FireRed and
          LeafGreen, and Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!; it is also
          accessible in Pokémon Gold, Silver, Crystal, HeartGold, and SoulSilver
          after the quest in Johto is completed. All cities in Kanto are named
          after colors (Viridian City, Lavender Town, Indigo Plateau, etc.),
          with the exception of Pallet Town, which is also a reference to color.

          Sound, is located south of Sinnoh. It is the setting of Pokémon Gold,
          Silver, Crystal, HeartGold, and SoulSilver. Johto and Kanto are part
          of a large landmass, with everything west of Indigo Plateau falling in
          the Johto region. It was the second core series region to be
          introduced. Players begin their journey in New Bark Town, where
          Professor Elm offers either Chikorita, Cyndaquil, or Totodile to
          beginning Pokémon Trainers. The English-version names of most of the
          cities in Johto are also the names of plants or things related to
          plants.

          It is located south of Sinnoh. It is the setting of Pokémon Ruby,
          Sapphire, Emerald, Omega Ruby, and Alpha Sapphire. It was the third
          core series region to be introduced. Hoenn is inspired by the
          real-world Japanese main island of Kyushu. The names of most of the
          cities in Hoenn are made of two words put together (Little Root, Fort
          Tree, Slate Port, Ever Grande, etc.) rather than colors or plants as
          Kanto and Johto had done. Professor Birch of Littleroot Town offers
          the starter Pokémon known as Treecko, Torchic, or Mudkip to Trainers
          beginning their journey of this vast land.

          It is located north of Kanto, Johto, and Hoenn. It is the setting of
          Pokémon Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum. It was the fourth core series
          region to be introduced. Sinnoh is composed of the large mainland, the
          Battle Zone on another landmass to the northeast, and several smaller
          islands on both sides of the region. Most of Sinnoh's routes are on
          land, having very few water routes, in vast contrast to Hoenn. The
          region is divided by Mt. Coronet, roughly comparable to how the
          continent that Kanto and Johto make up is essentially a contiguous
          region. Starter Pokemon are Turtwig, Chimchar, and Piplup.

          inhabit Unova are diverse and different from those of Kanto, Johto,
          Hoenn, and Sinnoh. Although it is geographically based on New York
          City, it draws inspiration for its landmarks from the entire state of
          New York, which features a mixture of rural locations and urban areas
          as well as factory towns and industrial complexes. Starter Pokemon are
          Snivy, Tepig, and Oshawott.

          Paradise. It is a popular resort destination and attracts a lot of
          tourists from other regions. In Alola, humans and Pokémon coexist in a
          very close relationship, and a culture has developed that is different
          from other regions. Starter Pokemon are Rowlet, Litten, and Popplio.
